1.  [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com)

    **HackerRank** is currently my favourite programming site. There is a lot of
    exercises and they are split in different categories - **Algorithms**, **Java**,
    **Functional programming**, **Databases**, etc. Everyone will find something
    interesting. In many cases solutions can be submitted using **different
    languages** - solve one in **Java** and then try the same in a functional language!

    I really like one thing about this site - they show output (even incorrect) of
    submissions. This one, small feature helps a lot figuring out what is wrong
    with the submitted code. Compare that with terse "*Wrong Answer*" on other
    sites.

1.  [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)

    This site has a collection of very **interesting problems** and learning
    resources. Of course, there is a bunch of pure algorithmic problems, like on
    other sites, but the most interesting part is their collection of
    **bioinformatics** problems to solve with helpful learning resources. It's very
    cool site where one can see how algorithms can be used to solve real world
    challenges!

1.  [SPOJ - Sphere Online Judge](https://www.spoj.com)

    Very known site with plenty of **algorithmic problems**. **SPOJ** also allows to use
    **different programming languages**, even very esoteric. These days I visit it
    less often, but it's still a good site.

1.  [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/login)

    It's one of the oldest contests sites. At the beginning there were only
    algorithmic competitions, but with time they've added other type
    competitions - software design, testing, graphical design, etc.
   
    **TopCoder** is the only site I know of, where one can earn some money in
    programming contests.

1.  [We Chall](https://www.wechall.net)

    **We Chall** is not a programming/contest site by itself, but it keeps a global
    ranking from many **security contests** sites (often **Capture The Flag** type). Very
    interesting challenges that require broad IT knowledge. One site which I like
    but is not on **We Chall** is [Backdoor - Security platform](https://backdoor.sdslabs.co).

1.  [4clojure](https://4clojure.oxal.org)

    In **Clojure** community the site is very well known. It contains (ATM) 156
    problems ranging in difficulty from easy to hard. By solving them you can
    learn quite a lot of nice tricks in **Clojure** and feel the beauty of the
    language. Don't forget to enroll to **code golf league**! :-)

1.  [CodeKata](https://codekata.com)

    Contrary to mosts programming sites that focus around algorithms and such,
    **CodeKata** has a list of problems that will exercise you in different
    directions. The katas set goals that will make you think about modeling of
    problem domain, different trade offs, etc.

1.  [exercism](https://exercism.io)

    **exercism.io** is very interesting and unusual site with programming exercises
    that aid in **learning a new language**. It has at least two things that make the
    site exceptional:
    1.  Command line client for fetching and submitting solutions.
    2.  Programmers are encouraged to **Code Review** other solutions. IMHO being able
        to see how others have solved the same problem is a great way to learn a
        language. Just try it! :-)

1. [Code Fights](https://codefights.com)

    I discovered **Code Fights** just recently, but found their approach to the
    **competetive programming** quite amusing. In other places you can take your time
    and solve problems slowly, here the time runs really fast and your competitor
    is trying to solve the same problems faster than you. It's like playing coding
    game! :-)

1. [Code Chef](https://www.codechef.com)

    A good site with plenty of problems and a lot of tutorials.

1. [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

    A series of challenging mathematical and programming problems.

1. [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.practice.geeksforgeeks.org/)

    Problems to solve in **C**, **C++**, **Java**, and **Python**.

1. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)

    Data Science (machine learning) problems and competitions.

1. [Code Forces](https://codeforces.com)

    Well known site with lots of problems and competitions.

1. [Coding Game](https://www.codingame.com)

    A nice site where you can improve your skills by coding games in various languages.

1. [Python Challenge](https://www.pythonchallenge.com)

    A fun site to practice Python.

1. [CS Academy](https://csacademy.com)

    Programming contests (C++, Java, Python, C#) and tutorials.

1. [Hacker Earth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)

1. [Leet Code OJ](https://leetcode.com)

1. [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com)

1. [Codility](https://codility.com)

1. [Code eval](https://www.codeeval.com)

1. [UVa Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org)

1. [Lint Code](https://www.lintcode.com)

1. [CodeStepByStep](https://www.codestepbystep.com)

1. [HPC University Weekly Challenge](https://hpcuniversity.org/students/weeklyChallenge/)


# The book about Competitive Programming

Recently I've discovered a great book exactly about *competitive programming*: "Competitive Programming, 3rd Edition" by Steven Halim and Felix Halim.


And where do you practice programming? Let us know in the comments!
